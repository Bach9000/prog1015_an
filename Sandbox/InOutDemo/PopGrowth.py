# Description: The population of the United States was 
# about 281 million in 2000 and is predicted to be about 
# 404 million in 2050. Approximate the percentage population 
# growth in the United States during the first half of the 21st 
# century. Write a console application that calculates the percentage 
# population growth and then round that percentage to the nearest whole number.


def main():
    # Input and Variables

    Pop2050 = 404


    # Processing
    PercentageGrowth = Pop2050/Pop2000
    
    # Output
    print(round(PercentageGrowth)

# Description: Develop a short term loan calculator program as 
# a console application with the following specifications. Begin 
# by designing your solution to this problem in pseudocode, which 
# will be submitted along with the program.
# If A dollars are borrowed at r% interest compounded 
# weekly to purchase something with weekly payments for n years, 
# then the monthly payment is given by the formula:
# If: i  = r/5200 
# Then calculate the monthly payment as:
# monthly payment  =  i/1 â€“ (1 + i)-52n	* A
# Write a console application that calculates the weekly payment 
# after the user gives the amount of the loan, interest rate, and number of years.
